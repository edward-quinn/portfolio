I am a Senior Data Analyst and a published health researcher. My PhD training was in epigenetics and health equity, where I used R to analyze over 400 million data points.

My skill set is currently expanding to include Shiny, SQL, Python, and Tableau. In my spare time, I love to travel and watch mixed martial arts.
