# An renv cheatsheet

1. Use `renv::init()` to start a brand new project. This creates an renv.lock file listing packages and versions.
2. Install packages as normal using `install.packages()`
3. Occasionally use `renv::snapshot()` to capture updates to your virtual environment within the renv.lock file
4. After you finish a post, use `renv::snapshot()` one last time.
5. Copy the renv.lock file into the root directory for the particular post you just finished. `cp renv.lock path_to_blog_post_directory/`
6. Add the code chunk below which specifies using the local renv.lock file using `renv::use(lockfile = "renv.lock")`


# Use the local renv lock file to recreate virtual environment
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: 'hide'

#renv::use(lockfile = "renv.lock")
```
