# A cheatsheet for windows

1. Make sure you are in the directory where you want to create a virtual environment.
2. Use the following code: `python -m venv .venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment using `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
4. pip install whatever it is you need to install. 
5. Export dependencies by using `pip freeze >> requirements.txt`
6. Deactivate the virtual environment by using `deactivate`
7. Make sure to add .venv to your .gitignore file before committing.
